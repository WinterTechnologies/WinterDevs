# Kick Player
## About
Want to kick a bad player from your game? Or stop players from joining? You can use the `:Kick()` function to kick them.

## Snippets
```lua filename="ServerScriptService/kickplayeronjoin.lua" showLineNumbers copy
local Players = game:GetService("Players") -- Gets players service

Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(plr) -- Gets player when they join the game
	plr:Kick("You got kicked.") -- Kicks player
end)
```

```lua filename="ServerScriptService/kickcommand.lua" showLineNumbers copy
local Admins = {"flvffywvffy", "YOURUSERNAME"} -- Add as many admins as you want

game.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
    if (table.find(Admins, player.Name) ~= nil) then -- Check admin messages only.
        player.Chatted:Connect(function(message, recipient)
            local splitmsg = string.split(messsage, "/")
            if (splitmsg[1] == "kick") then
                local playertokick = messsage[2] -- Get the target player name.

                if (playertokick ~= nil and game.Players:FindFirstChild(playertokick) then -- Check for the player and kick them.
                    game.Players:FindFirstChild(playertokick):Kick("You have been kicked");
                end
            end
        end)
    end
end)
